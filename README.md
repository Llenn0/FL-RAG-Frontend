# FL-RAG-Frontend

This repository contains a React TypeScript website for interaction with a RAG AI Chatbot. The user can upload documents (PDF format) to be used as context, and communicate with the chatbot via a user-friendly interface. Currently, it is a minimal Proof of Concept that contains only the key features. The corresponding API service expected by the website can be found at FL-RAG-Backend.
